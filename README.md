Hands-on task using Wireshark to capture live network traffic.

Task 5 â€“ Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark
ðŸ“Œ Objective

Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

ðŸ›  Tools Used

Wireshark (free, open-source packet analyzer)

ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed

Installed Wireshark and selected the active network interface.

Started live capture.

Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging a server.

Stopped capture after ~1 minute.

Applied filters (http, dns, tcp, tls, quic) to analyze packets.

Exported capture file as .pcap.

Summarized findings in a short report.

ðŸ“¡ Protocols Identified

HTTP â†’ Web communication between browser and server.

DNS â†’ Domain name to IP address resolution.

TCP â†’ Reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol.

TLS â†’ Secure encrypted communication (used in HTTPS).

QUIC â†’ Modern, faster transport protocol over UDP (used by Google/YouTube).

ðŸ“‚ Deliverables

report.md â†’ Short report of protocols and findings.

âœ… Outcome

Gained practical experience in capturing and analyzing packets.

Understood roles of common network protocols.

Developed awareness of traffic patterns in real-world browsing.
